_This policy is effective as of September 21, 2025._

---

### Introduction

Welcome to NotePlus! This Privacy Policy explains how RoukoApps ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information. Your privacy is our top priority, and we have designed NotePlus to be a secure and private space for your thoughts.

### Information We Collect (and Don't Collect)

NotePlus is an offline-first application. This means we do NOT collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to our servers.

#### 1. Information You Provide:
The notes, titles, and content you create are stored locally and securely on your device's internal storage. We have no access to this information.

#### 2. Information We DO NOT Collect:
Because NotePlus does not have internet access, we do not collect any Personal Identifiable Information (PII), analytics, usage data, device information, location, contacts, or any other data from you or your device.

### Data Storage and Security

All your notes are stored in a private, sandboxed database on your device. We rely on the security features of the Android Operating System to protect this data. Your notes do not leave your device unless you choose to back them up.

### Data Backup and Restore

NotePlus uses Android's built-in Auto Backup service to back up your app data (your notes) to your personal Google Drive storage. This process is managed entirely by Google and is subject to Google's Privacy Policy. We do not have access to your backup files.

### Third-Party Services

NotePlus does not use any third-party services like analytics, advertising networks, or social media SDKs that could collect data from you.

### Children's Privacy

Our app does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
